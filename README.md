## Introduction

This repository contains a Python Jupyter Notebook designed to analyze various aspects of a transport and logistics company's operations using the `TransportAndLogistics` database schema. The analysis addresses key business questions across multiple categories, including delivery performance, fleet management, product category insights, customer satisfaction, cost optimization, and more.

The notebook provides SQL queries and Python code for data extraction, visualization, and actionable insights. It is structured into sections corresponding to specific categories of questions.

## Database Schema Overview

The `TransportAndLogistics` database includes the following tables:

- **Customers**: Details of customers who receive shipments.
- **Shippers**: Entities sending goods.
- **Consignees**: Entities receiving goods.
- **Vehicles**: Information about vehicles used for transportation, including fuel efficiency and capacity.
- **Drivers**: Details of drivers responsible for deliveries.
- **Routes**: Details of routes between origin and destination cities, including distance and estimated duration.
- **Shipments**: Records of shipments, including shipper, consignee, route, vehicle, and status.
- **Invoices**: Financial records for shipments.
- **MaintenanceRecords**: Maintenance history of vehicles.
- **FuelConsumptionRecords**: Fuel consumption data for vehicles.
- **UserRoles** and **Users**: Authentication and role-based access control.

For a detailed schema definition, refer to the `schema.sql` file in this repository.

## Analysis Categories

### 1. Delivery Performance Analysis
- Average delivery time for shipments across different regions.
- Routes or zones experiencing the most delays and contributing factors.
- Comparison of actual vs. promised delivery times and on-time delivery percentages.
- Seasonal patterns in delivery delays and mitigation strategies.

### 2. Fleet Management and Resource Optimization
- Identification of underutilized/overused vehicles and rebalancing fleet allocation.
- Fuel consumption rates per vehicle type and variation by route.
- Estimation of vehicles required during peak demand periods.
- Maintenance schedule adherence and its impact on vehicle uptime.

### 3. Product Category Analysis
- Contribution of product categories to delivery volume and revenue.
- Products prone to damage during transit and reasons for damage.
- Impact of product dimensions (size, weight) on transportation costs and efficiency.
- Special handling requirements for certain product categories.

### 4. Customer Satisfaction and Retention
- Top reasons for customer complaints and solutions.
- Customers generating the highest revenue and their delivery satisfaction scores.
- Correlation between delivery performance and customer retention rates.
- Geographic areas with consistently low customer satisfaction.

### 5. Cost Optimization
- Main cost drivers in logistics operations (fuel, labor, maintenance, etc.).
- Cost and profitability of each route.
- Reduction of idle time for drivers or vehicles through better scheduling.
- Effectiveness of pricing strategies in covering operational costs.

### 6. Route Planning and Optimization
- Optimal routes for delivering goods to multiple destinations in a single trip.
- Impact of real-time traffic conditions on delivery times and dynamic route adjustments.
- Selection of warehouses or distribution centers for specific regions.
- Alternative modes of transport for reducing costs or improving speed.

### 7. Inventory and Warehouse Management
- Average time shipments stay in warehouses before being dispatched.
- Bottlenecks in warehouse loading/unloading processes causing delays.
- Warehouses with excess or full capacity.
- Accuracy of inventory level predictions for upcoming orders.

### 8. Risk Management and Compliance
- Likelihood of disruptions affecting key routes and contingency plans.
- Compliance with transportation regulations (weight limits, hazardous materials).
- Frequency of accidents and root causes.
- Insurance claim frequency and reduction strategies.

### 9. Forecasting and Demand Planning
- Expected demand for transportation services in the next quarter.
- Impact of changes in customer ordering patterns on logistics needs.
- Prediction of peak periods and resource adjustments.
- Accuracy of forecasts and contributing factors to errors.

### 10. Technology and Innovation
- Leveraging IoT sensors for real-time shipment tracking.
- Adoption rate of digital tools among drivers and warehouse staff.
- Effectiveness of analytics dashboards in providing actionable insights.
- Opportunities for integrating AI/ML models for predictive maintenance or route optimization.

### 11. Environmental Impact
- Carbon footprint per shipment and reduction strategies.
- Waste generated in packaging materials and sustainable practices.
- Eco-friendly alternatives for fuel or vehicle types.

### 12. Employee Productivity and Training
- Average deliveries completed by drivers per day and regional variations.
- Common challenges faced by drivers and training/technology solutions.
- Disparities in performance metrics between teams or locations.
